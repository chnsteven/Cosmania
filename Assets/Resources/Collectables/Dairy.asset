    I''ve been working at this place for a few months.

    Frankly,
    I never met my master. I only heard her voice through the door when I left her
    food in front of the door. I was curious at first, but quickly lost interest
    in her true identity.

    I really don''t like
    how it feels around here. Everytime I drive to this mansion, I am scared. But,
    it''s a good opportunity to make me braver. After all, who doesn''t like high 
    salary with little amount to work?

    I don''t
    know why the workers I hired are so afraid of me. Is it because I live in a mansion
    far from where most people live? Or is it because I like to stay alone and never
    met them in person?
