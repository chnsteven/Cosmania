I am a detective. I received a request from a rural landowner to investigate a murder case.
The dark surroundings and the cold wind thrill me a little. But I am not afraid as I am a brave detective. 
Right now I am sitting in a car, driven by a worker from the mansion I am heading to. 
I can tell he is not a talkative man, so I avoided talking to him too much. 
I am close to my destination. Let's see what kind of secret is hidden at this place.
